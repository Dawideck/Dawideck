Hey! 

My name's Dawid. 

I've studied IT n-teen years ago, but resigned and went to study what I thought was my passion - music.

Years have passed and it seems that an old polish proverb's wisdom dawned upon me.
**"Old love does not rust."**
And so I'm back in IT. Or at least I'd like to get my head back in the game...

I'm trying my skills as a software tester. Although, I would like to pursue a career as an automated software tester in the future :)

! Getting a kick out of playing with *RaspberryPi* computers with a bunch of different sensors. 

I'm also a father-to-be and would really love my kid to feel the joy of compiling your own code :)

FunFact#139487: In the olden days I took a liking to ActionScript for Flash....... aaaaaand it's gone.
